    "It's fine if your agents are incapable of solving the problem for the presented start state and goal due to the excessive length of the necessary plan. If this the case, simplify the problem by changing the start state and/or the goal. The idea of this task is to show that your implementations are correct and the agents are capable - in principle - of solving this problem, not waiting for hours on end for computations to complete."
